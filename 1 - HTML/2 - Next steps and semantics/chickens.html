<!--
  Inside and Block Elements:

  Inside elements fit in alongside other elements.
  Block elements take up the whole line.

  Anchor elements are inline elements, so they share the same line with other inline elements.
  Paragraph elements are block elements, so they take up the whole line, the same as heading elements.
-->

<!--
  div and span:

  'div' is the block generic container element for grouping elements.
  It has no effect on the content or layout of the page until you apply CSS to it.

  'span' is an inline container element for phrasing content, which does not inherently change the content or layout of the page.
  It is used to apply styles to a piece of text or wrap a piece of text for styling purposes.
  It should be used when no other semantic element conveys the meaning you want to apply.
  span is very much like div, but it is an inline element, so it can be used inside of block elements.
-->

<!--
  Odd Assortment of Elements:
  
  'hr' is a thematic break element, which represents a paragraph-level thematic break, e.g., a scene change in a story, or a transition to another topic within a section of a reference book.
  It is typically rendered as a horizontal line.

  'br' is an inline element, which represents a line break.
  It is typically used to separate text or elements on the same line.
  One example could be in a poem, where each line is separated by a line break.

  'sup' is an inline element, which represents a superscript, typically used for footnotes or mathematical exponents.

  'sub' is an inline element, which represents a subscript, typically used for chemical formulas or footnotes.
  Is is the opoosite of 'sup'.
-->

<!--
  HTML Entities:

  Entities are used to display reserved characters in HTML.
  They start with an ampersand (&) and end with a semicolon (;).
  For example, the less than sign (<) is displayed as &lt; and the greater than sign (>) is displayed as &gt;.

<!--
  Semantic Markup:

  Semantic markup is the use of HTML markup to reinforce the meaning of the information in webpages rather than merely define its presentation (look).
  It is the use of HTML tags to reinforce the meaning of the information in webpages.
  "What purpose or role does this HTML element have?" is the question to ask when deciding which element to use.

  Instead of using a div or span element, use a more specific element that conveys the meaning of the content.
  For example, use a 'header' element for a header, a 'footer' element for a footer, a 'nav' element for a navigation bar,
  a 'section' element for a section of content, an 'article' element for an article, a 'main' element for the main content of the page, etc.

  The advantage of using semantic markup is that it makes the content more accessible to users with disabilities (i.e. screen readers), 
  improves search engine optimization (SEO), and makes the content easier to maintain and understand.

  - 'main' is a block element, which represents the main content of the document.
  It should be unique to the document and not be used more than once.
  Content that is repeated across multiple pages should not be placed inside the 'main' element, like a navigation bar or footer.

  - 'nav' is a block element, which represents a section of the document that contains navigation links.
  It could be links to other pages, links to other sections of the same page, or links to other parts of the same document.
  It could be the sidebar, the footer, the header of the page, etc.

  - 'section' is a block element, which represents a generic standalone section of a document or application.
  It does not have a specific meaning, but it is used to group related content together.
  Typically, but not always, a section would have a heading.
  Far better than a div element, which has no semantic meaning.

  - 'article' is a block element, which represents an independent piece of content that can be distributed and reused independently.
  It represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable.
  It typically includes a heading that explains what the article is,
  and can include any type of content, such as text, images, videos, audio, etc.
  Examples include a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, a blog entry, a user-submitted comment, an interactive widget, or any other independent item of content.

  - 'aside' is a block element, which represents a piece of content that is only indirectly related to the main content of the document.
  They are typically placed as sidebars or callouts, and can contain information that is tangentially related to the main content.

  - 'header' and 'footer' are block elements, which represent the header and footer of a section or page.
  Both will typically contain headings, navigation links, copyright information, etc.
  You can put headers/footers inside of other elements, like a section or article, to represent the header/footer of that section or article.

  - 'time' is an INLINE element, which represents a specific period in time or a range of time.

  - 'figure' is a block element, which represents a unit of content, optionally with a caption (using figcaption), that is self-contained and typically referenced as a single unit.
  It can contain images, videos, illustrations, diagrams, code snippets, etc.

  - 'abbr' is an INLINE element, which represents an abbreviation or acronym, optionally with its expansion.
  Examples include "HTML" (HyperText Markup Language), "CSS" (Cascading Style Sheets), "NASA" (National Aeronautics and Space Administration), etc.

  - 'data' is an INLINE element, which represents its contents, along with a machine-readable form of those contents in the value attribute.
  It can be used to represent a value that is not intended to be seen by the user, but is intended to be used by scripts or other programs.

  There are more. Just keep in mind that the goal is to use the most specific element that conveys the meaning of the content, instead of using a generic containers, like div or span element.

        The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a type of domesticated
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowl">fowl</a>, a subspecies of
        the red junglefowl (Gallus gallus). They are one of the most common and
        widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as
        of 2018[1], up from more than 19 billion in 2011.[2] There are more
        chickens in the world than any other bird or domesticated fowl.

        chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and
        eggs) and, less commonly, as pets. Originally raised for cockfighting or
        for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the
        Hellenistic period (4thâ€“2nd centuries BC).

        Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia,
        Southeast Asia, an d East Asia,[5] but with the clade found in the
        Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originating in the Indian
        subcontinent. From ancient India, the domesticated chicken spread to
        Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to Greece by the 5th century BC.[6]
        Fowl had been known in Egypt since the mid-15th century BC, with the
        "bird that gives birth every day" having come to Egypt from the land
        between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose
        III.[7][8][9
