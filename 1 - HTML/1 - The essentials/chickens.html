    This is an HTML document. It is the most basic building block of a website.
    It is made up of elements, which are represented by tags.

    HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content.

    This html file is a simple example of an HTML document, 
    following the structure of this page "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken"
-->

<!--
    This is how you write a comment in HTML.

    You can use the command CMD + / to comment out a line.
    To uncomment, use the same command.

<!--
    If you write "!" and then click TAB, you will get the basic structure of an HTML document.
    Which is this:
        DOCTYPE
        html
            head
                title
            head
            body
                ...
            body
        html

    The structure of an HTML document is:
        - DOCTYPE: The declaration of the document type and version of HTML.
        - html: The root element of an HTML page.
        - head: Contains metadata about the document, such as its title.
        - title: The title of the document, which is displayed in the browser tab.
        - body: Contains the content of the document, such as text, images, links, etc.
        - h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6: Heading elements, which define the structure of the document.
        - p: Paragraph elements, which contain text content.
        - b: Bring attention to text.
-->

<!--
  TIP:
  If you use the command Shift + Option + F, you can format the code.
-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- 
    The DOCTYPE declaration is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in.
    It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags).
    The DOCTYPE declaration is not case sensitive.
-->

<html>
  <!-- 
    The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page.
    It is the container for all other HTML elements (except for the <!DOCTYPE> declaration).
-->

  <head>
    <!-- 
        The <head> element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the <html> tag and the <body> tag.
        Metadata is data about the HTML document. Metadata is not displayed.
    -->

    <title>Chicken - Coltipedia</title>
    <!-- 
            The <title> element is required in all HTML documents and it defines the title of the document.
            The <title> element is the text that is displayed in the browser tab.
            It is shown in the browser tab, not on the page.
            Google use this title to display in search results.
        -->
  </head>

  <body>
    <!-- 
        The <body> element contains all the contents of an HTML document, such as text, hyperlinks, images, tables, lists, etc.
        The <body> element is the content of the document.
        There is only one <body> element in an HTML document.
    -->

    <h1>Chicken</h1>
    <!--
            You can only have ONE h1 element per page. And it takes one line.
            Don't worry about the size of the text, you can change it with CSS later.
        -->

    <p>
      The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a large and round
      short-winged <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird">bird</a>,
      domesticated from the red junglefowl of Southeast Asia around 8,000 years
      ago. Most chickens are raised for food, providing meat and eggs; others
      are kept as pets or for cockfighting.
    </p>

    <!--
            This is a paragraph element.
            You can have as many of these as you want.
            Paragraphs are usually represented in visual media as blocks of text separated 
            from adjacent blocks by blank lines and/or first-line indentation, but HTML 
            paragraphs can be any structural grouping of related content, such as images 
            or form fields.
        -->

    <p>
      Chickens are common and widespread domestic animals, with a total
      population of 23.7 billion as of 2018, and an annual production of more
      than 50 billion birds. A hen bred for laying can produce over 300 eggs per
      year. There are numerous cultural references to chickens in folklore,
      religion, and literature.
    </p>

    <h2>Terminology</h2>

    <!-- 
            This is a heading element.
            There are six levels of headings in HTML, from h1 to h6.
            h1 is the highest level and h6 is the lowest.
            You can have as many h2 elements as you want.
            h2 elements are used to represent the most important heading on the page.
            h1 is the most important heading.

        An unordered list starts with the <ul> tag. Each list item starts with the <li> tag.
        -->

      <!--

          For example using Roman numerals, or we ca chage the bullet points to make it looks different.

    <h2>The Anchor element</h2>

    <p>
      The <b>anchor</b> element is used to create hyperlinks between a source
      anchor and a destination anchor. The destination anchor is defined by the
      href attribute. The source anchor is the text, image, or button that the
      user clicks on to follow the link.
    </p>

    <a href="https://www.google.com">This is a link</a>
    <!--
        This is an anchor element.
        The <a> tag defines a hyperlink, which is used to link from one page to another.
        The most important attribute of the <a> element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination.
        The link text is the part that will be visible to the reader.

        href: The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to.
    -->

    <a href="about.html">About Page</a>
    <!--
      We can link to other pages in our website.
    -->

    <h2>The image embeded element</h2>

    <p>
      The <b>image</b> element is used to embed an image in an HTML page. The
      src attribute specifies the URL of the image. The alt attribute provides
      an alternate text for an image, if the image cannot be displayed.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is a bad practice to change the size of the image with HTML. You should
      use CSS for that.
    </p>

    <img src="assets/html_structure.png" alt="HTML structure">
    <!--
        This is an image element.
        The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page.
        
        The src attribute specifies the URL of the image.
       
        The alt attribute provides an alternate text for an image, if the image cannot be displayed.
        It holds a text description of the image.
