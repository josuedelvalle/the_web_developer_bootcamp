<!--
    The Form element is used to create an HTML form for user input.
    Examples of form elements include text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, submit buttons, etc.

    Some attributes:
    - action - specifies where to send the form-data when the form is submitted.
        The request can point to a page on the same server or on a different server.
    - method - specifies the HTTP method to use when sending form-data.

    When you submit a form, a HTTP request is sent and we control where that request goes with the action attribute.

<!--
    Most common element:
    - <input> - defines an input field where the user can enter data.
        The input types are: text, password, submit, reset, radio, checkbox, etc. It is extremely versatile.
            + The 'type' attribute dramatically alters the input's behaviour and appearance.
            + The 'placeholder' attribute provides a hint to the user of what can be entered in the field.
              Is the text that appears in the input field when it is empty.
    
    With the input element we can get quite a variety of different types of inputs or form controls.
