<!--
    The Form element is used to create an HTML form for user input.
    Examples of form elements include text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, submit buttons, etc.

    Some attributes:
    - action - specifies where to send the form-data when the form is submitted.
        The request can point to a page on the same server or on a different server.
    - method - specifies the HTTP method to use when sending form-data.

    When you submit a form, a HTTP request is sent and we control where that request goes with the action attribute.

    You can find more infor here:
    https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form
-->

<!--
    Most common Form element:
    - <input> - defines an input field where the user can enter data.
        The input types are: text, password, submit, reset, radio, checkbox, etc. It is extremely versatile.
            + The 'type' attribute dramatically alters the input's behaviour and appearance.
            + The 'placeholder' attribute provides a hint to the user of what can be entered in the field.
              Is the text that appears in the input field when it is empty.
    
    With the input element we can get quite a variety of different types of inputs or form controls.

<!--
    Make sure your inputs are label properly.

    Labels are used to describe the purpose of the input field.
    The 'for' attribute of the label element should be equal to the 'id' attribute of the input element.
    This way, when the user clicks on the label, the input field is activated.
    
    The id attribute is used to associate the label with the input field.
    Now, when the user clicks on the label, the input field is activated.

    https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/label
-->

<!--
    Button element:
    - <button> - defines a clickable button.
        The button element is used to create a clickable button.
        Inside a button element you can put text (and images) and you can also add event handlers.
        The button element represents a clickable button, which can be used in forms or anywhere in a document that needs simple, standard button functionality.
        By default, HTML buttons are presented in a style resembling the platform the user agent runs on, but you can change buttons' appearance with CSS.
        The button element is a container for phrasing content, whereas the input element is a self-contained element.

    In case for the form, the button element will take the action attribute of the form element.
    The button is sending a request to the server because I am submitting the form.

    When I have a button in a form and I don't explicity say this should not submit the form, it is going to submit the form.
    For this we can use the 'type' attribute with the value 'button' to avoid the form submission. By default, the type attribute has the value 'submit'.

<!--
    The name attribute is used to identify form data after it has been submitted to the server.
    One value could be 'q' for a search query, or 'username' for a username input field.

    Example: <input type="text" name="username" />

    <h2>Our First Form</h2>

    <!-- Form -->
    <!-- The action attribute specifies where to send the form-data -->
    <form action="/tacos">
      <p>
        <!-- Label -->
        <!-- Label for the input field -->
        <label for="username">Enter a Username:</label>
        <!-- Input field -->
        <!-- Text input field -->
        <!-- 
            Here we set the name attribute to 'username', so when we submit the form, the data will be sent with the name 'username' 
            This will be the resquest: /tacos?username=the_value_of_the_input
        -->
        <input id="username" type="text" placeholder="username" name="username" />
      </p>

        <!-- Label -->
        <label for="password">Enter a Password:</label>
        <!-- Password input field -->
        <!-- The name attribute is set to 'password' -->
        <input type="password" placeholder="password" id="password" name="password" />

        <!-- Label -->
        <label for="color">Enter a Color:</label>
        <!-- Color input field -->
        <input type="color" id="color" name="color" />
      </p>

      <p>
        <!-- Label -->
        <label for="number">Enter a Number:</label>
        <!-- Number input field -->
        <input type="number" placeholder="enter a number" id="number" name="num" />

        <!-- Label -->
        <label for="time">Enter a Time:</label>
        <!-- Time input field -->
        <input type="time" id="time" name="time" />
      </p>

      <!-- Buttons -->
      <!-- This button doesn't submit the form b/c of the "type" attribute -->
      <button type="button">Regular button (won't submit)</button>
      <!-- This button submits the form! -->
      <button>Submit</button>
      <!-- Another way to create a button (but not good syntax) -->
      <input type="submit" value="Click Me!" />
    </form>

    <!--
        If we fill all the form fields the request will be:
        /tacos?username=the_value_of_the_input&password=the_value_of_the_input&color=the_value_of_the_input&num=the_value_of_the_input&time=the_value_of_the_input
    -->

    <hr />
    
    <!--
        This button is outside the form, so it is not going to submit the form.
        We could use JavaScript to do something when the button is clicked.

    <button>Button outside the form</button>
    
    <h2>Hijacking Searches</h2>

    <p>
        Now we are going to build our own search form for Reddit, Google and Youtube
        where we can send data to their server from our form and end up
        actually getting a search result.
    </p>
    <p>
        We need to take advantage of the 'action' attribute of the form element,
        and make sure we <b>follow the correct URL structure for the search query</b>.
    </p>

    <h3>Search Reddit</h3>
    
    <!-- Reddit Search Form -->
    <form action="https://www.reddit.com/search">
        <input type="text" name="q">
        <button>Search Reddit</button>
    </form>

    <h3>Search Google</h3>

    <!-- Google Search Form -->
    <form action="https://www.google.com/search">
        <input type="text" name="q">
        <button>Search Google</button>
    </form>

    <h3>Search Youtube</h3>

    <!-- Youtube Search Form -->
    <form action="https://www.youtube.com/results">
        <input type="text" name="search_query">
        <button>Search Youtube</button>
    </form>

    <p>
        There is no need to have a button in the form to submit the form.
        We can just press the 'Enter' key on the keyboard to submit the form.
    </p>

    <!-- Youtube Search Form -->
    <form action="https://www.youtube.com/results">
        <label for="youtube">Search on Youtube:</label>
        <input type="text" name="search_query" id="youtube">
    </form>
