/* 
Box Model:
- The box model is a very important concept, one that you must understand 
    to be able to create layouts effectively.
- The box model is a model that describes how the space around an element 
    is distributed.
- The box model consists of four parts: the content, padding, border, and margin.

Content:
- The content is the actual content of the element, such as text, images, etc.
- The content is surrounded by padding, border, and margin.
- The content can be set using the width and height properties.

Padding:
- The padding is the space between the content and the border.
- The padding is used to create space around the content.
- The padding can be set using the padding property.

Border:
- The border is the line that surrounds the padding and content.
- The border is used to separate the content from the padding and margin.
- The border can be set using the border property.

Margin:
- The margin is the space between the border and the surrounding elements.
- The margin is used to create space between elements.
- The margin can be set using the margin property.

/*
Height and Width:
- The height and width properties are used to set the height and width of an element.
- We can set the height and width of an element using the height and width properties.

/*
Border:
- The border property is used to set the border of an element.
- We can set the border of an element using the border property.

There are dozens of border related properties, because there are different 
pieces that we can control. The thickness, the style, the color, and then we
can do that for the left, right, top, and bottom sides. Plus, we can do things like 
rounding the corners.

The most common border properties are:
- border-width: Sets the width of the border.
- border-style: Sets the style of the border.
    Styles: solid, dotted, dashed, double, groove, ridge, inset, outset, none, hidden.
    We can control the top, right, bottom, and left sides separately.
    Example: border-top-style, border-right-style, border-bottom-style, border-left-style.
- border-color: Sets the color of the border.

Other properties:
- box-sizing: Sets how the total width and height of an element is calculated.
- border-left-width, border-right-width, border-top-width, border-bottom-width: Sets the width of the border on each side.
- border-left-style, border-right-style, border-top-style, border-bottom-style: Sets the style of the border on each side.
- border-left-color, border-right-color, border-top-color, border-bottom-color: Sets the color of the border on each side.
- border-radius: Sets the radius of the border corners.
    We can use pixels, but the best way is to use percentages.
    We can control the top-left, top-right, bottom-right, and bottom-left corners separately.
    Example: border-top-left-radius, border-top-right-radius, border-bottom-right-radius, border-bottom-left-radius.

The border property:
- The border property is a shorthand property that allows us to set the width, style, 
    and color of the border in one declaration.
- The border property can take up to three values: width, style, and color (in that order).
- If we only specify one value, it will be used for all sides.
- If we specify two values, the first value will be used for the top and bottom sides, 
    and the second value will be used for the left and right sides.
- If we specify three values, the first value will be used for the top side, 
    the second value will be used for the left and right sides, and the third value 
    will be used for the bottom side.
- We can also use the border-top, border-right, border-bottom, and border-left properties
    to set the border of each side separately.
