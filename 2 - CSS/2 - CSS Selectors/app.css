/* 
Universal selector:
- Selects all elements on the page
- It is not commonly used
- Syntax: *
- Example: * { margin: 0; padding: 0; }

Element selector:
- Selects all elements of a specific type
- For example, all <h1> elements; p; img; etc.

Selector list:
- Selects all elements that match any of the selectors in the list
- Syntax: selector1, selector2, selector3
- We can use the comma to select multiple elements
- Example: h1, h2, h3 { color: red; }
*/

/* 
ID Selector:
- ID is a unique identifier for an element.
- It is used in HTML to identify an element, and we can use it in CSS to style that element.
- Keep them to a minimum, and use them only when necessary. There are more strategies and approaches to styling elements.

- Selects an element with a specific ID
- Syntax: #id
- Example: #main { color: red; }
*/

/*
Class Selector:
- Selects all elements with a specific class attribute
- By defining a class, you can apply the same style to multiple elements.

- We can use the class attribute to apply the same style to multiple elements
- You will have group of things/elements that you want to style in the same way. You can use the class attribute to apply the same style to multiple elements.

- The difference between ID and class is that an ID can only be used once in a document, while a class can be used multiple times.
- You will use classes more often than IDs. But both are important.

- Syntax: .class
- Example: .main { color: red; }

REMEMBER --> ID with '#' and class with '.'
*/

/*
Descendant Selector:
- Selects an element that is a descendant of another element
- Syntax: selector1 selector2
- Example: div p { color: red; } - selects all <p> elements inside a <div> element
*/

/*
Adjacent Selector:
- Selects an element that is directly adjacent to another element
- Syntax: selector1 + selector2
- Example: h2 + p { color: red; } - selects the first <p> element that is placed immediately after an <h2> element

Direct Child Selector:
- Selects an element that is a direct child of another element
- Syntax: selector1 > selector2
- Example: div > p { color: red; } - selects all <p> elements that are direct children of a <div> element
