/*
Flexbox

- Flexbox is a layout mode that provides for the arrangement of elements 
on a page such that the elements behave predictably when the page layout 
must accommodate different screen sizes and different display devices.

- Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout method for laying out items in rows
or columns. Items flex to fill additional space and shrink to fit into
smaller spaces.

Important:
Focus on concepts, not memorizing the properties!

/*
First step to create a flexbox layout --> display: flex;
- flex: enables a flex context for all its direct children.
  this is the first step to make a flexbox layout. with this property
  we are basically turning it on.
*/

/*
The Flex Model:
- Main Axis: the main axis of a flex container is the primary axis along
  which flex items are laid out. The main axis is defined by the flex-direction
  property.
- Cross Axis: the axis perpendicular to the main axis is called the cross axis.
  Its direction depends on the main axis direction.
*/

/*
Flexbox properties:

- flex-direction: row | row-reverse | column | column-reverse;
  - this property defines the direction in which the children of the
    container are placed.
  - row: default value. items are placed the same as the text direction.
  - row-reverse: items are placed opposite to the text direction.
  - column: items are placed top to bottom.
  - column-reverse: items are placed bottom to top.

- justify-content: flex-start | flex-end | center | space-between | space-around;
    - this property aligns the children of a container.
    - justify-content is not horizontal or vertical, it can be either
        depending on the flex-direction. The way it behaves depends on the
        main axis.
    - flex-start: default value. Items are placed at the start of the container. 
    - flex-end: items are placed at the end of the container.
    - center: items are centered in the container.
    - space-between: items are evenly distributed in the container.
    - space-around: items are evenly distributed in the container, with
        space around them.
    - space-evenly: items are distributed so that the spacing between any
        two items (and the space to the edges) is equal.

- flex-wrap: nowrap | wrap | wrap-reverse;
    - this property defines whether the children are forced into a single
        line or can be wrapped onto multiple lines.
    - example use case: when the children are too big to fit in the container.
    - nowrap: default value. all items are on one line.
    - wrap: items wrap onto multiple lines.
    - wrap-reverse: items wrap onto multiple lines in reverse.

- align-items: flex-start | flex-end | center | baseline | stretch;
    - this property aligns the children of a container.
    - align-items is not horizontal or vertical, it can be either
        depending on the flex-direction. The way it behaves depends on the
        cross axis. It is going to distribute the children in the cross axis.
          + justify-content: main axis
          + align-items: cross axis
    - flex-start: items are placed at the start of the cross axis.
    - flex-end: items are placed at the end of the cross axis.
    - center: items are centered in the cross axis.
    - baseline: items are aligned such as their baselines align.
    - stretch: items are stretched to fit the container.
