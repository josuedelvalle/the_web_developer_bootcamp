# CSS

CSS, *Cascading Style Sheets*, is a language for describing how documents are presented visually - how they are arranged and styled.

CSS is very easy to get the hang of,  but it can be intimidating because of how many properties we can manipulate.

Whenever we write CSS, we are writing **CSS rules**. Almost everything you do in CSS follows this basic pattern:
```
selector {
    property: value;
}
```

For example, this is how we would modify the color of all the `h2` elements on our page and the `image` elements size:
```
h2 {
    color: purple;
}

img {
    width: 100px;
    height; 200px;
}
```

There are tons of properties what you can use at any point. That does not mean you need to know them all at once or that you need to memorize them. Nobody expects you to be a master of every single property - the ones that you use the most you'll just naturally come to remember, but the ones you don't use or very frequently use, you'll just look them up. None of it is terribly complicated, fortunately, but there's just a lot.
